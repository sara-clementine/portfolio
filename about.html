    <p>One of my first memories involved art. I remember sitting at a plastic kiddie table at the age of three painting a castle with a cheap watercolor set. My mother has always been a painter and a crafter. She encouraged her children to dabble in the arts right alongside her. Through the years, I have tried painting, drawing, throwing pottery, writing, taking photos, and playing guitar. <span>Some of these activities, like playing guitar, I practice to this day, while others just gave me a further appreciation for the world around me.</span></p>
    <p>Growing up in an artistic household, I grew to be a very empathetic person. My favorite moments are those when I can go with people into their world to get a better understanding of where they are coming from. These moments can be anywhere from taking a trip to a friend’s childhood home to just hearing a person’s perspective that I had never considered before. I earned my bachelor’s degree in English Literature for this reason. I view books almost as an in depth conversation with the author - a sneak peak behind the veil of the story. After graduating from college, I have taken on a number of customer facing roles in different industries. Communicating with diverse populations has been a very gratifying experience.

    <span>Why design?</span>
    </p><p>
    When I learned about the role UX/UI design plays, I was instantly attracted to it. I have spent years helping people orient themselves to a product or an experience, and I view UX research as taking the next step on that pathway. It blends my love of creating and my love of understanding people. My degree has helped me to better understand others stories and perspectives. This ability was strengthened by working directly with customers to solve their issues.  <span>I want to apply my love of helping others in a way that can make a real difference in people’s day-to-day life.</span></p>
