    <h1>MEDI+FILE Case Study</h1>
    <img src="./images/projectHeader.png" class="lgimg">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Storage for medical files no matter which provider, medical system, or location.<br>
      Cloud storage sites can be used in a multitude of ways. We were tasked with finding a cloud storage solution that could break into the market and quickly develop a network of users. After researching the current market and user preferences, MEDI+FILE was created.</p>

        <p>“We're really excited at the possibilities we see in the cloud storage and organization market. Even with multiple big-name competitors in the space (Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Evernote, Pinterest, etc.), we feel like the market is still young and there's room for another player if we can find the right combination of features to meet the needs of a particular audience”

        The goal of the project was to develop a cloud storage solution that would be able to break into </p>

      <div class="column">
        <p>an already saturated market. In particular, the goal was to have a cloud storage site that not only provides something that you cannot get on other cloud storage sites, but also a site that from its very start encourages network building. The network building was stressed in the project brief as a feature that would be necessary for the site’s growth.</p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <p>The project grew from the prompt, aided by research and user testing, into MEDI+FILE. MEDI+FILE is a patient portal platform that allows doctors and patients to connect. Other patient portal websites currently up and running today tend to lack essential features that users want. Some may offer file sharing, some may offer appointment booking, but all do not offer both to the user on an easy to use platform. Many patient portal platforms are only for one doctor’s office or one health system, so that if </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>you were to go to a specialist you may be forced to sign up for a secondary service. MEDI+FILE’s goal is to simplify the connection between doctors and patients by allowing patients to use one service for all of their providers. An added benefit of MEDI+FILE is that it allows users to leave their doctor’s office paper-free! Instead of bringing home a stack of papers to get misplaced or immediately thrown out, users can access all records and instructions given by the doctor in their connection page with that doctor. This is an easier option for many users, and this is a more environmentally friendly option.</p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <h5>SWOT Analysis</h5>
        <p>When looking to the current market of cloud storage solutions, there are clear front-liners: Google Drive and DropBox. They offer the most versatile and robust services, allowing users to store nearly any type of file. Users can store up to 2GB with DropBox and 15GB with Google Drive for free before signing up for a subscription service. Both are accessible from basically anywhere with an internet connection. The user survey backed up my analysis that these two services are the go-to’s. <br><br>The other service that I researched in this stage was Pinterest. Pinterest has a more specialized approach to cloud storage by focusing on grouping interesting links and images. Users can go through and create boards of images and links to share with others.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>Conclusion of SWOT Analysis:
          The products above for the most part are for general usage, meaning they are not created for one particular industry or purpose. They are meant to hold the type of data they are set up for with various perks and features depending on which service you choose. A new product could most easily enter the market by catering to a particular industry. If a product was able to look at all of the resources the average team in a specific field used and set up a service around that, then it could potentially be much more useful than a more general-use cloud service product. Also, if there was a particular type of data or service that was being overlooked by your average cloud storage site, then a new service could get an edge on the market by offering to host such data or service.</p>

        <h5>User Survey</h5>
        <p>Through the user survey, we were able to test what users found to be the most important features of cloud storage services and what they look for in a cloud storage service. From the survey question below, it is was very clear that the most important feature for users is the ability to upload files; secondly, the ability to share and collaborate on files.
        <br><br>
        The survey also gave a few situations in which a cloud storage service could be used - in a professional setting, in a doctor’s office, and in a home for a hobby. Most participants stated that they would use a cloud storage service in</p>
        <img src="./images/survey 1.png" alt="survey question">
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>their field, if it proved to be necessary, useful, and confidential. Also, the majority of users said they would use a cloud storage service in a doctor’s office setting, citing some concern over confidentiality and security of their protected health information (PHI). The majority said they would not use a cloud storage service for a hobby.
        <br><br>
        Participants mostly fell between with ages of 25 and 34. Also, the majority of participants were from the U.S.A. with no state being more represented than others.</p>

        <h5>User Personas</h5>
        <p>User persona 1 is skeptical of using a cloud storage service in a medical office setting. She is worried about the security of her PHI. She will need to be ensured that this information is safe before considering using such a service.
        <br><br>
        User 2 is less skeptical of a medical office-based cloud storage service. He also has general concerns about the safety of his information, but he has other concerns like losing data.</p>

        <h5>User Stories & Flows</h5>
        <p>From the survey and the personas created, it became clear that if we were going to continue down the path of a medical office cloud storage service, we needed to focus on security. A 2-step verification process for logging in was a clear solution. Other actions on the site came from researching other patient portal websites.</p>

        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <p>For the branding I looked to other medical services to see what colors and branding techniques they were using. It became clear that there were two important colors that communicated different messages: red is for emergency services and blue was for non-emergency services. Red is a very common color in the medical field; however, the service is not for emergency services and we did not want to send that message to the users. So blue became the natural choice. Along with a few shades of blue, we included its complementary color - yellow. The two colors later became the themes of the doctors’ and patients’ experiences.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>The main brand color is dark blue: symbolizing security, trustworthiness, and passivity. Medi-file is a secure site for your protected medical information - we are not going too playful or colorful of a theme. The beige and light yellow will be used sparingly as pops of color to bring user's attention to a particular element. The brand font is Josefin Sans. It works well for the logo, making it clean and iconic looking. It will also be used for the H1's on the page. The complementary font is Open Sans, which is a clean, generic font. Medi-file is pro-accessibility and legibility, so a simple complementary font makes sense.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>MEDI+FILE is a service that I honestly wish was out there for use. The purpose of it being a tool to be used by all to better connect with their doctors held true to the final prototype. Ease of use and focus on the features allowed it to follow through with the original premise. The one aspect that I wish I had more time for was the user testing. The user testing, as previously </p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <p>stated, did not generate much feedback. I believe that more extensive user testing with a more diverse population would result in more actionable feedback. Overall, the process of bringing MEDI+FILE from its inception to research to final design has been an essential learning experience.</p>
